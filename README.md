3DOF IMU Controlled Robot

This project was to test the limits of the MPU9250 as a controller for a 3DOF robot manipulator. The MPU9250s are placed on a person's arms which represent their arm's angles. The robot is then able to use the pitch and positions from the IMU's to perform both forward and inverse kinematics. 

The robot and arm controller both use the ESP32 micro controller.
